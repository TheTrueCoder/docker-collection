When downloading Unreal it has one 12GB layer download that is ridiculously slow compared to the rest. This image will test how big a layer can be until this behavior happens.
A selection of files are made with incompressible random data of various sizes to represent a worst case scenario. A file of zeros would compress perfectly and is not representative of real software.

# Speed test

I tested downloads on a Vultr VM in New York with the 100GB NVME SKU.

- Unreal 5.0.2 from my docker hub: 14m 56s
